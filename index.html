					<h3>Introduction to our Experiment</h3>

        	<p>Myotonic goats (otherwise known as fainting, wooden leg, stiff, nervous, and scare goats) have gained attention and popularity for their tendency to faint when startled. This heritable medical condition known in the scientific community as myotonia congenita is a condition in which muscle cells experience prolonged contraction. This condition is caused by abnormal sarcolemmal ion conductance which facilitates reduced firing of action potentials resulting in sustained muscle contraction (Beck, 1996). “Many studies have led to the conclusion that the fundamental electrical abnormality of resting myotonic fibers is a reduced chloride conductance” (Lehmann et.al., 1999). Consequently, the animal tends to fall over with the four legs stiffened-out, restricting movement. </p>
					<p>Goats that are less affected may only exhibit some leg stiffness as they move away. Some goats experience stiffness only rarely. This stiffness is painless to the animal (Cannon, 1996). Because of muscular activity during episodes, myotonic goats tend to have an overall increase of muscle mass (Sponenberg, 2005). The reaction to myotonic episodes differ with the the ages of goats; younger goats tend to react by falling over, while older goats learn to stagger away with their legs stiffened. Though goats with this condition appear to be fainting, they do not lose consciousness during an episode.</p>

						<p>This breed originated in the 1800’s when a farmer realized that he owned four goats that exhibited stiffness. These goats were also less apt to climb fences or escape from pastures, had good muscular conformation, and high levels of reproduction. These traits were highly valued by some breeders who continued to emphasize meat qualities and select for growth rate, conformation, and reproductive efficiency (Myotonic or Tennessee Fainting Goat, 2016). Other breeders continued to breed these goats to preserve myotonic stiffness. This breed is a landrace meaning it survived as a local untracked population of goats bred for beneficial qualities.  Because of this, there is a large degree of variability.  In addition, they are admired for their tendency to have a variety of colors. Their genetic value of this breed it is recognized as having high conservation priority by the livestock conservancy. </p>
						<p>Though myotonia congenita may cause increased muscle conformation this trait may hinder the survival of the animal by making them more vulnerable to predators. Our research program will focus on examining the possibility to maintain the muscular conformation of this breed without exhibiting the survival inhibiting qualities resulting from myotonia congenita and demonstrated by the tendency to falling over and seizing up when startled. We predict that it is possible to preserve muscle conformation and other beneficial traits of the breed and either decrease the intensity of myotonic episodes so that it is not survival inhibiting or remove the trait from a population of myotonic goats altogether.</p>
