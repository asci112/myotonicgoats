        	<p>&nbsp;</p>


        	<p>In part one of the experiment, we test whether the correlation between the severity and occurrences of myotonic episodes is related to good muscle conformation. Part two was to determine if it was possible to reduce severity or breed out myotonia congenita altogether.</p>
					<p>In terms of anticipated results: for part one of this experiment, we can expect that there will be significant statistical evidence for positive correlation between the severity of myotonia congenita and muscle conformation. Many, if not all, of the goats that have high muscle-to-bone ratio will have a higher degree of myotonia congenita (based on the severity and occurrences of the myotonic episodes). The muscle stiffening episodes that myotonia congenita induces can help to strengthen and build up the goatsâ€™ muscles, which results in better muscle composition.</p>

					<p>For part two, there will be a generally decreasing trend in the degree of myotonia congenita. The goats will also be able to maintain high muscle conformation and other beneficial qualities. The younger the generation is, the lower its degree of myotonic episodes and the higher its meat-to-bone ratio will be. While it is unlikely that we would be able to completely remove myotonia congenita from the population altogether, we could reduce the severity of myotonic occurrences to a degree that does not inhibit survival.</p>
