       	  <h3>Part One</h3>
        	<p class="weirdo">Determining the correlation between the severity and occurrences of myotonia congenita and good muscle conformation</p>


					<ol>
						<li>Secure four populations of myotonic goats.</li>
						<li>Choose 5 goats in each population that are ready to be processed as meat goats.</li>
						<li>In a four month period facilitate a startled reaction in these goats. Observe and collect data regarding the reactions of these goats when startled.</li>
						<li>Rate the degree of myotonia congenita (based on severity and occurrences when stimulated) in each goat.</li>
						<li>Process these goats.</li>
						<li>Measure the overall muscle to bone ratio.</li>
						<li>Run statistical tests to determine if there is statistical significance of a positive correlation between good muscular conformation (high meat to bone ratio) and degree of myotonic events. </li>
					</ol>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Part Two</h3>
        	<p class="weirdo">Breeding program to decrease presence of myotonia congenita</p>

          <ol>
						<li>Observe myotonic episodes of offspring and rate the degrees of myotonia congenita (based on severity and occurrences when startled) and high muscle conformity (assessed and selected through thorough examination).</li>
						<li>Allow F1 generation to reach Breeding program to decrease presence of myotonia congenita maturity and select breeding pairs based the lowest degrees of myotonia congenita as well as maintaining high muscle conformity and other valuable qualities of the breed.</li>
						<li>Repeat this process for future F generations. Make sure to use good breeding practices to prevent inbreeding depression.</li>
						<li>After the F10 generation, assess the trend of the degree of myotonia congenita among offspring to see if there is a general decreasing trend in the degree of myotonia congenita while maintaining high muscle conformity and other beneficial qualities of the breed.</li>
						<li>Run statistical tests to determine if results are statistically significant. If so, breeding can reduce the degree and severity of myotonic occurrences in goats while maintaining good muscle conformity. If not, further breeding may be needed or breeding myotonia congenita out of goats while maintaining the high muscle conformity and other valuable characteristics may not be possible.</li>
